for us and jp versions:
- for sypha, alucard, and trevor:
    - can turn around in mid-air
    - falling off a cliff results in jumping instead (retain control)
    - knockback is forgiving, directional input restored after a moment
- 6B can be beated even if the bone dragon is defeated from the LEFTMOST platform
- A-01 downward scroll-screen section, air-control is retained
